# INTRO

This is a Data Analysis and Machine Learning project which seeks to the utilize some Python 3.0 Data Analysis tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for some
basic Data Analysis while also using three main classification Algorthms of the Sklearn ML library.

## The three (3) Models used are 
* The basic Logistic Regression Model - `LogisticRegression()`
* The more advanced K Neighbors Classifier - `KNeighborsClassifier()`
* The highly more advance Random Forest Classifier -`RandomForestClassifier()`
